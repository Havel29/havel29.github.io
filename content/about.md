Hi! I'm **Luca Boscarato**, also known as **Havel29** in the cybersecurity/gaming community. I'm a computer science student and researcher with a passion for tackling complex challenges at the intersection of artificial intelligence and security.

Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the Free University of Bolzano, I focus on exploring how machine learning can address problems previously considered intractable. My approach combines rigorous mathematical reasoning with practical implementation, always seeking elegant solutions to difficult challenges. I believe that the most valuable skill in technology is not knowing specific tools, but rather the ability to understand complex systems, identify patterns, and develop innovative solutions.

My involvement in competitive cybersecurity has shaped my analytical thinking significantly. In 2023, I represented my university at [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/), Italy's national cybersecurity competition, as part of a 6-member team. This experience deepened my understanding of security principles and problem-solving under pressure. Since 2024, I've continued my involvement with the program as a Cryptography instructor, where I guide students in developing their analytical and security mindset.

I'm driven by curiosity and the constant pursuit of new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge. Whether it's designing secure systems, developing machine learning solutions, or exploring the mathematical foundations of cryptography, I approach each problem with enthusiasm and a commitment to understanding it deeply. I believe that true expertise comes not from memorizing syntax or frameworks, but from cultivating a problem-solving mindset that adapts to any challenge.
